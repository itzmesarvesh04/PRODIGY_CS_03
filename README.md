🔒 Password Complexity Checker Tool 

 I'm demonstrating a Password Complexity Checker tool that I developed during my cybersecurity internship with PRODIGY INFOTECH. This tool assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria including length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

✅ Features:

-- User-friendly interface with color-coded feedback for easy interpretation.
-- Options to check password complexity and exit the program.
-- Results displayed in real-time, providing instant feedback to users.

🖥️ Technology Stack:

--> Developed using Python programming language.
--> Utilized the colorama library for adding color to the console output.

🔍 Internship Experience:

During my internship, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity concepts and practical applications. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in Python programming, regular expressions, and user interface design. I learned how to effectively communicate security concepts to end-users in a clear and accessible manner.

💡 Key Takeaways:

--> Enhanced understanding of password security best practices.
--> Improved coding skills through practical application.
--> Developed a user-friendly tool with real-world applications.
--> I'm excited to continue learning and contributing to the field of Cybersecurity. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey!
